                        <br>
                        <p>At Jump Simulation Center, I took part in an ambitious project that aimed to revolutionize medical training through the integration of <strong>spatial computing</strong> technologies with <strong>Extended Reality (XR)</strong> devices. The goal was to create highly immersive, interactive medical environments that replicate real-world scenarios, providing medical students and professionals with hands-on experience like never before.</p>

                        <p>To bring this vision to life, I developed the backend infrastructure using <strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>Express.js</strong>, which enabled real-time interactions between trainees and the AI-powered chatbot. Powered by <strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</strong> and <strong>OpenAI's GPT-4 model</strong>, the chatbot played a crucial role by offering guidance throughout simulated medical procedures. It answered complex questions and provided key insights during critical moments. A big part of my role was fine-tuning the chatbot's responses by connecting it to a specialized medical database, ensuring accuracy and relevance during the simulations.</p>
                        
                        <p>This project wasn't just about guiding users—it was about completely transforming the training experience. I worked closely with a team of healthcare professionals to design interactive 3D environments that were synchronized with the AI chatbot, allowing trainees to manipulate virtual medical tools and practice procedures in real-time. These <strong>XR-powered</strong> simulations offered a seamless learning experience, immersing trainees in realistic medical scenarios where they could experience the same pressure and precision as they would in real-life situations.</p>
                        
                        <p>Another key aspect of the project was training a specialized <strong>Large Language Model (LLM)</strong> for medical purposes. This allowed the AI assistant to provide contextually relevant, adaptive responses during simulations, enhancing the overall depth and realism of the training. I worked closely with healthcare experts to continuously refine the system, ensuring that it met the stringent standards required for medical training.</p>
                        
                        <p>From backend development to real-time <strong>AI integration</strong>, this project utilized a wide range of technical skills. I used <strong>Python</strong> to train the LLM, and <strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>Express.js</strong> to build the chatbot infrastructure. Additionally, I employed <strong>XR technologies</strong> to develop the interactive simulations. This project not only pushed the boundaries of AI in medical education but also demonstrated how advanced technology can revolutionize training in complex fields like healthcare.</p>

                        <p>As a <strong>Research Assistant</strong> at the Social Computing System Lab, I worked closely with <strong>PhD students</strong> to explore the potential of integrating <strong>Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong> into <strong>Extended Reality (XR)</strong> systems. My role involved conducting thorough literature reviews, analyzing cutting-edge research, and synthesizing findings to understand how <strong>LLMs</strong> could enhance the interactivity of virtual environments. We aimed to discover new ways to make XR experiences more responsive and adaptive to users, elevating the overall immersion and engagement.</p>
    
                        <p>Throughout this project, we investigated how <strong>LLMs</strong> could significantly improve the adaptability of <strong>XR platforms</strong>, making virtual environments more intelligent and interactive. The goal was to enable real-time, context-aware responses within these virtual spaces, transforming how users interact with virtual agents and the environment itself. By identifying gaps in existing technologies, we proposed solutions that leverage <strong>LLMs</strong> to offer richer and more dynamic user interactions.</p>
                        
                        <p>As a co-author, I contributed to a research paper that we've submitted to the <strong>CHI 2025</strong> conference. The paper showcases how integrating <strong>LLMs</strong> with immersive technologies could redefine <strong>human-computer interaction (HCI)</strong> by creating more engaging and intelligent virtual experiences. Our research demonstrates how <strong>LLMs</strong> can enhance not only conversational interactions but also decision-making processes within XR environments, resulting in more immersive and responsive experiences for users.</p>
                        
                        <p>The research also highlights how <strong>LLMs</strong> can enhance not only conversational interactivity but also decision-making processes within the XR environment, enabling a more holistic and immersive user experience. Through rigorous analysis and collaboration, we identified key factors contributing to the success of this integration, laying the groundwork for future developments in the field.</p>

                        <p>One of my key responsibilities was leading the integration of OpenAI's <strong>GPT-3.5 Turbo</strong> into the project, allowing the virtual agents to engage users in natural, seamless conversations. This conversational AI added a dynamic element to the MR experience, making interactions feel more intuitive and engaging. In addition to the backend work, I also contributed to developing interactive 3D elements in <strong>Unity</strong>, ensuring smooth transitions between the virtual and real worlds. These transitions were crucial in creating an experience that felt fluid and immersive for users.</p>
                        
                        <p>To manage user interactions efficiently, I worked on a <strong>MongoDB</strong> database that handled over 10,000 records. Optimizing the database was key to ensuring fast performance and smooth access for all users. Throughout the project, I collaborated with UX researchers, conducting rounds of user testing to gather feedback and improve both functionality and user experience. This iterative process helped us refine the system, ensuring that the MR environment was not only technically sound but also engaging and user-friendly.</p>
                        
                        <p>Together with my team, I co-authored a research paper that explores how integrating <strong>Large Language Models (LLMs)</strong> like GPT-3.5 can enhance user interactions in MR environments. The paper, which was submitted to the prestigious <strong>CSCW25 Conference</strong>, offers insights into how LLMs can make virtual agents more responsive and adaptable. Our research highlights the potential of LLMs to transform virtual experiences, making them more interactive, intelligent, and immersive for users.</p>
